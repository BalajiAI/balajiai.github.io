I'm Balaji Varatharajan, an ML Researcher. I currently work as a Research Engineer at Collective Intelligence
Systems (CIS) research group at Siemens Technology. I also've previously interned at a research
lab at IIT Kharagpur where I worked on Federated Learning. I'm also the Core Team member at
[CORD.ai](cordai.org) where I'm mostly guiding the budding researchers.

My broader research interests are Machine Learning with a focus on Learning theory, Reinforcement Learning
and ML for Biology. While I'm not doing research, I mostly read books on topics which I don't know,
study Mathematics, Running and ofcourse spending time with people.
I'm also looking forward to meet new people, so if you're interseted in talking with me, shoot me
an email.
